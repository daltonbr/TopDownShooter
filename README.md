##This is a project based on [another tutorial from Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SviIeTt2_Lc&list=PLFt_AvWsXl0ctd4dgE1F8g3uec4zKNRV0) (an awesome developer and tutor, follow him on Youtube)

I've added some elements to the game and on top of that I implemented a Bot using the concept of *Utility AI*
